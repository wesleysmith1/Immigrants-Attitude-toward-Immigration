            There will be one Assigner, 4 Green Solvers, and 4 Blue Solvers.  And Solvers will be divided into  Type 1 Solvers  and Type 2 Solvers
        </li>
        <li>
            All Green Solvers  and 2 randomly selected Blue Solvers are Type 1 Solvers
        </li>
        <li>
            Remaining 2 Blue Solvers  are Type 2 Solver
        </li>
        <li>
            These roles are randomly assigned, but the same in every round
        </li>
        <li>
            Solvers will participate in multiplication activities for 30 seconds in each round
        </li>
        <li>
            Type 1 Solvers  are always eligible to participate in multiplication Activities
        </li>
        <li>
            Each Type 1 Solver decides whether to make the Type 2 solvers eligible to participate in the multiplication activities
        </li>
        <li>
            The decision of one randomly chosen Type 1 Solver will be implemented
        </li>
        <li>
            The assigner  assigns eligible Solvers to Activity A or Activity  B
        </li>
        <li>
            Assigned solvers answer multiplication questions (Activity A or Activity B) for 30 seconds
        </li>
        <li>
            For Type 1 solvers in Activity A each activity involves finding the product of two randomly chosen single-digit numbers and Solvers earn .50 points (half a point) for each activity
        </li>
        <li>
            For Type 2 solvers in Activity A each activity involves finding the product of two randomly chosen single-digit  numbers three times and earn 0.50 points (a quarter point) for each activity
        </li>
        <li>
            For Type 1 solvers in Activity B each activity involves finding the product of two randomly chosen single-digit  numbers and earn 0.25  (a quarter point) points for each activity
        </li>
        <li>
            For Type 2 solvers in Activity B each activity involves finding the product of two randomly chosen single-digit numbers and earn 0.25 points (a quarter point) for each activity
        </li>
        <li>
            During payment, the employer's points will be equivalent to dollars, while each employee's points will be multiplied by 3 to determine the corresponding dollar amounts.
        </li>
