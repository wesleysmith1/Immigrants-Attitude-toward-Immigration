    <div>
        The randomly chosen Type 1 Solver decides to make the Type 2 Solvers eligible to participate in Activities.
    </div>

    <div>
        The Assigner assigns 4 Type 1 Solvers to Activity A, and 4 Type 1 Solvers to Activity B.
    </div>

    <div>
        If a Solver performs 60 Activity A, the Solver earns  (60)($0.5) = $30.
    </div>

    <div>
        If a Solver performs 48 Activity B, the Solver earns (48)($0.25)= $12.
    </div>

    <div>
        Suppose the total completed Activity A and Activity B by Solvers are 220 and 180. In that case, the Assignerâ€™s round earnings are
    </div>

    <h3>(0.8*200+ 0.5*180)-(0.5)(220)-(0.25)(180)= $32.87.</h3>

    <div>
        There will be 30 rounds of the experiment, and one round will be randomly chosen for payment.
    </div>

    <div>
        Before we begin the experiment, you will play a practice round. In the practice round, you will play as an Assigner or a Solver, and your role will remain the same in the actual experiment. This is meant for you to familiarize yourselves with the experiment. Choices made in the practice round will be unpaid and will not affect the actual experiment.
