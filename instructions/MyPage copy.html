    <div>
        In today's experiment, there are 9 participants: 1 Assigner and 8 Solvers. The Solvers are divided into Type 1 Solvers and Type 2 Solvers. Additionally, each Solver is assigned a color: Green or Blue. All Green Solvers are Type 1, while 2 Blue Solvers are Type 1 and the remaining 2 will be Type 2. Roles are randomly assigned to the participants.
    </div>   
    
    <div>
        The Assigner's task is to assign all eligible Solvers to one of two multiplication activities: Activity A or Activity B.  Eligible in this context refers to whether or not a Solver is allowed to participate in one of the two multiplication activities. 
    </div>

    <div>
        Type 1 solvers are always allowed to participate in activities while Type 2 solvers are not initially allowed to participate in activities. Type 1 Solvers make decisions on the eligibility to participate in activities of Type 2 solvers. In other words, Type 1 Solvers have the authority to grant eligibility to Type 2 Solvers, allowing them to participate in the activities
    </div>

    <div>
        In Activity A, Type 1 Solvers are given individual multiplication questions to solve, while Type 2 Solvers are given three such questions to complete one Activity A. 
    </div>

    <div>
        For instance, a Type 1 Solver might be asked to calculate the product of 2 and 3 as part of one Activity A, while a Type 2 solver might be asked to calculate the products of 3 and 5, 7 and 8, and 4 and 9. 
    </div>

    <div>
        They can answer these questions for 30 seconds. The total amount they make during the round is the number of questions they answer in 30 seconds times 0.5. For example, if a Solver answers 30 questions in 30 seconds, the Solver earns $15.
    </div>

    <div>
        In Activity B, any Solver is asked to solve individual multiplication questions. Each question is finding the product of two randomly chosen single-digit numbers.
    </div>

    <div>
        For example, to complete one Activity B, a Solver might be asked to find the product of 3 and 7. For each question a Solver answers correctly, they earn $0.25.
    </div>

    <div>
        Solvers have 30 seconds to answer as many questions as they can. The total earnings for a round are calculated by multiplying the number of correct answers by $0.25. For example, if a Solver answers 30 questions correctly within 30 seconds, the Solver will earn $7.5.
    </div>

    <div>
        When the Assigner makes the assignments, they can see a Solver's color but not their Type. 
    </div>

    <div>
        There are 2 Type 2 solvers who are not initially able to be assigned. That is, the Assigner is not able to assign them to either Activity. If the randomly chosen Type 2 solvers decide to make the Type 2 solvers eligible then there are 6 solvers that must be assigned while if the Type 2 Solver makes them ineligible then there are 8 solvers that must be assigned. 
    </div>

    <div>
        All Type 1 Solvers are always eligible to participate in both Activity A and Activity B. 
    </div>

    <div>
        However, the eligibility of Type 2 Solvers is determined by the decision of one of the Type 1 Solvers. At the beginning of each round, Type 1 Solvers choose whether to make Type 2 solvers eligible. The decision of one randomly chosen solver is implemented.
    </div>

    <div>
        At the beginning of each round, each of the Type 1 Solver will be asked to answer the following question: Do you want to let the Type 2 Solvers participate in the Problem-Solving activity?
    </div>

    <div>
        Once each Type 1 Solver has answered this question, one of them will be chosen randomly. The choice made by the randomly chosen Type 1 Solver will then be implemented. If the randomly chosen Type 1 Solver 
    </div>

    <div>
        After this is determined, the Assigner must assign all the eligible Solvers to Activity A or Activity B.  If the two Type 2 solvers are eligible, then 8 solvers must be assigned. If the two Type 2 Solvers are ineligible, there are only 6 Solvers that must be assigned. 
    </div>

    <div>
        Note that if the two Blue Solvers are ineligible, all six Solvers are Type 1. If the Two Blue Solvers are eligible, then all the Green Solvers are Type 1, two Blue Solvers are Type 1, and two Blue Solvers are Type 2. The Assigner does not know which of the two eligible Solvers is Type 2.
    </div>

    <div>
        The Assigner's earnings are based on the number of completed Activity A and Activity B. Specifically, the Assigner earns the total number of completed Activity A multiplied by 0.8 plus the total number of completed Activity B multiplied by 0.5, minus the amounts of money given to the solvers for the completed Activity A and Activity B. For example, if 90 Activity A and 30 Activity B are completed, the assigner earns
    </div>

    <h3> (0.8)(90)+ (0.5)(30)-(0.5)(90)-(0.25)(30)= $34.5. </h3>

    <div>
        The Assigner's earnings will increase with the completion of Activity A and Activity B. However, if the number of Solvers assigned is small, such as 6, then the Assigner's earnings will likely be lower. Assigning Type 2 employees to Task A increases the chance of lowering the number of completed tasks and subsequently reducing the Assigner's earnings.
